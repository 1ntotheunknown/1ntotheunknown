My transformation would not have taken place if it were not for the event, the complications of which gave me a very strong impulse to act. In short, after an alcohol-drenched party, I woke up on the back of a truck, locked from the outside, without most of the valuables, including glasses. And that was just the beginning of my troubles ... More information about my weirdest adventures in "My biggest f**kups"

## Getting Started

One of the biggest moral kicks in my life. A few times earlier, I had woken up without valuables, battered and with a huge downside. But never in such a weak mental state as this time. The fact that I lost the glasses that my brother had given me for my birthday a few weeks earlier was the one that struck me the most. These glasses were very expensive .. So I knew that in the near future, starting this morning, I would be asked "Why aren't you wearing these new glasses?" All these things pissed me off so much that I said to myself ENOUGH. I knew that if I didn't start changing, I would only exist instead of living. I also knew, that if I will not change I will not cope in life... 

At 28, I was very overweight, no job, no girlfriend, and an amazing ability to disappoint people.

## First exercises

I had no idea where to start. So I started doing push-ups. 15 push-ups, that's what I managed to do at the beginning .. After a few days, I added running to it. Previously, the longest distance I could run was 5 km at a pace of 8 min / km, so with practically walking speed.

I decided to get back to running. Losing weight, on the other hand, is one of the reasons I wanted to run, the other reason is that I hate running and I wanted to punish myself. I started running distances no less than 5 km. When I was tired I was talking to myself, I was exactly saying to my head: are you tired? Don't you want to run any further? I won't let you rest and I will run on. You will suffer now for turning off my brain's consciousness at the last party. So running was and actually still is a way to punish myself for those events and to always remember it ...


## Starting my own Business

Starting my transformation, I knew that my body wasn't the only thing that needed change. All the time I had no job and no prospects. A few months back, I was a participant in a startup incubator. I spent 6 months on it and I didn't manage to start a business during that time. We had a team, we had an idea and we had an agreement with clients for our prototype, while our negotiations with the incubator on the terms of establishing the company failed. The requirements and conditions that they wanted us to include in the contract would make us slaves for the next 4 years and in fact they could deprive us of shares in our own company at any time.

However, there was one positive thing about it all. I met a few people. We did an online meeting, we did brainstorming, everyone gave a few ideas for a business, we chose one and started working. It is a continuous learning process. And spending hours and hours on achieving pre-defined goals. However, I hope it will be worth it. I'll try anyway. It won't be worse than it already is .. The whole adventure with your own business is described step by step in the "My business story" tab.

## My Big Dream and Bucket List

The big goal that I can't help but think of is to travel across Europe in a mini van.
However, for it to happen, you need a lot of money and work. First of all, the business that I started this year needs to start earning money so that I can buy such a van and afford such a trip. This is by far my greatest goal, because all I do is to be happy. I don't know if it really will give me happiness, but until I try it, I won't find out .. More info in the "The BiG Journey" tab

There are also many smaller more down-to-earth targets on my bucket list. And I will be meticulous in pursuing them. And for that too, the few previous steps must be successful. The most important one is business, because without money, I can only come up with new things that I would like to do.

## People That Inspire Me

The people who surround me and inspire me are a very important point in my transformation. I do not have any inspiration from the Internet, all the people I describe in this tab on the blog are people I know and see their daily efforts with my own eyes. The fact that I have insight into it gives me wings when I don't feel like doing anything.

# So... Lets begin!
