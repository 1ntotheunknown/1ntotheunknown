# What is this big dream?

The plan is to set off on a trip around Europe in a self-built van in January 2022. We'll see how it works, but I am also planning to attach a frame to the van to support the motorcycle. Mobility above all. Where I cannot get by van, I will gladly go on a motorbike :)

## Where did the idea for such a trip come from?

1ntotheunknown blog has this name because I need to go ahead without much plan. In 2020, I turned my life upside down. I quit alcohol, have not smoked for a year, lost over 20 kg and started a company. Why would that be enough for me? The further I am in my transformation, the more incentives I need. As I don't have a girlfriend, I create the company in such a way that everything can be supervised remotely, all I need is $$ to build a van and travel ahead.

When I was little, my parents used to take me on trips by plane to other countries. However, over the years, I do not remember anything. I totally changed my approach to traveling. I need to see all these places from a different perspective, without rush, without chasing flight dates or hotel bookings. If I find a country very interesting, I will just stay there longer. I've always been a loner so I guess that's what I'm looking for.


# We dream too much about making our dreams come true. I have lived this way for a very long time. Time to change it. Just take it step by step and never stop.
