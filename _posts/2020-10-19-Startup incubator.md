# How I got to the incubator

One day a friend of mine called me and told me that an incubator was looking for creative people with different business skills. He also said that for an innovative venture for which they are looking for people, not a business idea.
This information interested me. I went to their website at the urging of a friend and registered. They invited me to an introductory meeting. There were about 8 people at the meeting. Each of us was asked to introduce ourselves and say a few words about ourselves.
There were very different people, but mostly they specialized in Business, Marketing or Technology. Then we were divided into 2 groups and asked to read the case study and then to answer their questions as a team.
Thanks to the relaxed atmosphere and interesting people, the whole task ran quickly and smoothly. Afterwards, they gave us some time to talk to everyone face to face and take advantage of the catering.

A few days later I received an e-mail that I had moved to the next stage. I have been told that the next stage lasts the entire weekend and it will depend on whether I get into the program. It sounded interesting. I went ..
Large hall, about 30 people. Two rows of chairs opposite each other and a special application that measures your time. We had 2 minutes to get as much information as possible about each participant. A lot of confusion, a lot to remember, but all in all, in the excitement of meeting new people, you quickly relax and fly with your story.
Initially, just like on a tinder, after a while you know if you are interested in someone or not. We got a list of people we talked to and then we had to rate them. Thanks to the peer reviews, they selected several teams that competed against each other over the weekend.
Our task was to develop and present a copycat (a copy of an existing business), but in an improved version. We got a list of companies and time, not much time.

On the 3rd day there was a presentation, all candidates participated in it, as well as the management of the incubator, who came from another country. I presented the project, unfortunately we didn't win.
The winning team automatically entered the program. I was hailed as an individual winner and joined the program as well. A total of 14/30 people got into the program.

## Beginning

The first weeks were very interesting. Week after week we were told to work in other teams to develop new projects and business presentations. After each project, we were asked for opinions on the people we worked with.
One task stuck in my memory in particular. We were checked on various levels. The task was called "Sell or Die". We got $ 15 and 3 hours of time. We were told to multiply the money. Panic started, no one knew how to do it. The incubator was located in an open space where there were many other companies. We ran like crazy, asking other people if they  need anything. Whether to make shopping for them or to help them for money.
I got a contract to buy a sandwich and a drink for $ 2.50. And incredibly interesting one, I had to buy equipment for new open space users. Post-it notes, briefcases, punches, etc. Earned another $ 7. Then I ran 3 km for 20 packets of nachos, to a themed event organized by open space. Earned another $ 7.
When we had used up all the possibilities in the building, we went out into the streets and found an exit from the metro, where a lot of people were passing by. We were selling hugs, a gentleman came and said that he has no money but he painted us some calligraphy pictures so we could sell them, others just gave us money.
We got so caught up in this task that time would pass very quickly and we had to come back to the summary. It turned out that we dominated the competition. From the initial $ 15, we made a staggering $ 60. The runner-up group had just under $ 30.
From the very beginning, each of us overcame our weaknesses and uncertainties. It was not easy, very difficult to earn money, and even harder to ask for it.

## The final team composition and the program in a nutshell

After about 3-4 weeks and working with each incubation participant, they finally divided us into teams. Another challenge has appeared, we have co-founders, but what project should we do? It was hard to come up with something good. Our supervisors / mentors gave us a list of existing businesses that in their opinion and analysts of this incubator are worth emulating and copycat. Weeks passed and we bounced off new ideas. The weeks were as follows: brainstorming; business idea ; idea validation; too many obstacles; end of the week. After a long time (several months), we came across an interesting business idea. We found potential clients, we were extremely lucky to meet a technological person who wanted to join our team and made the project possible. When everything was going in the right direction and we were about to start the company, something went wrong. The contract with the Incubator was, to say the least, unfavorable. We hired a lawyer, he forbade us to sign it. OKAY. Including us, 2 more teams have withdrawn from the incubator, also in an advanced stage of operation. We all got non compete for a year. It all ended on December 31st. Without the project (all intellectual property remained in the Incubator) and with many months wasted, with practically exhausted savings (the Incubator required full commitment, so working elsewhere was not an option).

## All is not lost

We were left without business. But there is a team. January 1, 2020. Quick online call and question. "Gentlemen, we keep going"? They all answered yes.
Brainstorming lasted for several weeks. We came up with an idea. We act.
